# Project Overview

**Objective:** Predict patient readmissions within 30 days of discharge from a hospital.

## Data Collection

Data is sourced from the "Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set" available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset includes:

- Demographics
- Admission and discharge dates
- Medical specialty of admitting physician
- Number of lab tests performed
- Diagnosis
- Number of medications, including diabetic medications
- Number of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits in the year before hospitalization

## Data Preprocessing

### Cleaning
- Handle missing values
- Address outliers
- Correct incorrect data

### Feature Engineering
- Develop new features like time in hospital, patient's medical history complexity, changes in medication

## Model Development

### Traditional Machine Learning Models
- **Logistic Regression:** A good baseline for binary classification problems.
- **Random Forest:** Excels with non-linear data and provides feature importance.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Effective in high-dimensional spaces.

### Deep Learning Models
- **Feedforward Neural Networks:** Start with a simple architecture.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** Useful for the sequential nature of patient data. LSTM or GRU models could be particularly effective.

## Evaluation

- Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Deployment

Develop a web application or integrate into existing hospital management software for real-time readmission risk prediction.

## Comparison and Analysis

- Compare the performance of traditional models versus deep learning models.
- Analyze which features are most crucial for predictions and how different models handle these features.

This project provides insights into machine learning paradigms applicable in healthcare and practical experience in handling healthcare data.
